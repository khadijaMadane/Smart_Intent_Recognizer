# Smart Intent Recognition

**Smart Intent Recognition** is an advanced natural language processing project designed to accurately classify user intents using a fine-tuned BERT model. This project is aimed at enhancing user experience in applications like chatbots and virtual assistants by providing precise intent detection.

## Overview

This project leverages the [SNIPS Dataset](https://github.com/snipsco/benckmark-datasets), a comprehensive collection of natural language utterances paired with corresponding user intents. The model aims to understand and categorize user queries effectively.


## Key Features

- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art BERT architecture for improved intent classification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Integrated with Gradio for an interactive prediction experience.
- **Robust Evaluation**: Detailed metrics to assess model performance on unseen data.

- ## Dataset Overview

The **SNIPS Dataset** is a widely used benchmark for evaluating intent detection systems, comprising a collection of over 16,000 diverse user utterances categorized into various intents, such as "Book a Flight," "Get Weather Information," "Play Music," "Order Food," and "Get News Headlines." This dataset features a variety of phrases that users might say, reflecting different ways of expressing the same intent, which helps train robust models capable of generalizing well to real-world applications. Additionally, the SNIPS dataset is designed with a balanced distribution of intents to prevent bias toward any particular class during training. Each utterance is meticulously annotated with a corresponding intent, providing a clear mapping between user inputs and expected outputs. Utilizing this dataset enables the **Smart Intent Recognition** project to effectively comprehend user intents in conversational contexts and enhance the overall performance of NLP applications.
