# Smart Intent Recognition

**Smart Intent Recognition** is an advanced natural language processing project designed to accurately classify user intents using a fine-tuned BERT model. This project is aimed at enhancing user experience in applications like chatbots and virtual assistants by providing precise intent detection.

## Overview

This project leverages the [SNIPS Dataset](https://github.com/snipsco/benckmark-datasets), a comprehensive collection of natural language utterances paired with corresponding user intents. The model aims to understand and categorize user queries effectively.

## Key Features

- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art BERT architecture for improved intent classification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Integrated with Gradio for an interactive prediction experience.
- **Robust Evaluation**: Detailed metrics to assess model performance on unseen data.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-intent-recognition.git
   cd smart-intent-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
